# Xampp-Virtualhosts-manager
A GUI for managing virtualhosts in Xampp  Tested on windows

This was an onld file I used a while back, it stopped working and I was unable to find it online, so I tweaked it and got it working again.

Simply put the virtualhosts folder in your xampp directory and visit

http://localhost/virtualhosts

You will also need to give write permissions to the windows hosts file

usually located at C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc

That will allow it to write to that file.
